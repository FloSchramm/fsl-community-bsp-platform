Freescale's Community Yocto BSP
===============================

To get the BSP you need to have `repo` installed and use it as:

Install the `repo` utility:

$: mkdir ~/bin
$: curl https://dl-ssl.google.com/dl/googlesource/git-repo/repo > ~/bin/repo
$: chmod a+x ~/bin/repo

Download the BSP source:

$: PATH=${PATH}:~/bin
$: mkdir fsl-community-bsp
$: cd fsl-community-bsp
$: repo init -u https://github.com/Freescale/fsl-community-bsp-platform -b danny
$: repo sync

Once this has complete, you will have all you need. To start a build, do:

$: source ./setup-environment build
$: bitbake core-image-minimal

You can use any directory to host your build.

The source code will be checked out at fsl-community-bsp/sources.
